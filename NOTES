MAINTAINER NOTES

* "make dist" creates a tarball suitable for distribution (MUST keep ${BASEFILES} and ${DISTFILES} up-to-date)
* "make distclean" cleans the environment sufficient for checkin
* "make baseclean" purges auto* artifacts, leaving only the minimal base

* From a baseclean, "autoreconf" (part of auto* suite) will generate auto* artifacts.  So, from a baseclean
  $> autoreconf
  $> ./configure #--with-apxs, --with-openssl
  $> make
  $> make install # DESTDIR=/absolute/path/to/alternate/destination/directory
  $> make clean #for rebuild
  $> make dist #create tarball for distribution -- note, can only be done after successful ./configure
  $> make distclean #for svn ci
  $> make baseclean #fully cleansed for auto* maintainers

* Version number maintained in configure.ac:AC_INIT
